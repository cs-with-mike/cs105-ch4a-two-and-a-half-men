## Overview
In this assignment we are going to use our chosen language R to make a syntax analyzer based on the code in the textbook thats in c++. 
The first step is to convert the code one to one, and then try and use our chosen languages features to make it more efficient. 

## Design Notes
Some notable design decisions are: 

When converting the switch statements in c++ to R we could use a lookup table or if statements, 
so we chose a lookup table thinking they would be faster and easier to convert over.
